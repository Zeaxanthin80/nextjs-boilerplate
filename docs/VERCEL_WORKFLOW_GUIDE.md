## Quick Summary - Key Definitions

### Essential Terms
- **PR (Pull Request)**: A GitHub feature to propose and review code changes before merging into main branch
- **npm run dev**: Basic Next.js local development server using local environment
- **vercel dev**: Development server for Vercel-specific features (authentication required)
- **npm run dev**: Next.js development server (recommended for most development work)
- **Preview Deployment**: Temporary deployment of your changes for testing (automatically created from PRs)
- **Production Deployment**: Live website accessible to users (deployed from main branch)

### Additional Useful Terms
- **Branch**: Separate line of development in Git (like a copy of your code to work on)
- **Commit**: Snapshot of your code changes with a descriptive message
- **Merge**: Combining changes from one branch into another (usually into main)
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration values (API keys, database URLs) stored securely
- **Serverless Functions**: Code that runs on-demand without managing servers (in `/api` folder)
- **Edge Runtime**: Vercel's global network that runs your code closer to users
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic page refresh when you save code changes
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (automated testing and deployment)
- **Rollback**: Reverting to a previous version if something breaks
- **Staging**: Testing environment that mimics production

---

## Understanding the Integration

### Your Current Setup
You started with:
1. **Vercel Dashboard** → Created project from Next.js template
2. **Connected to GitHub** → Vercel created a new GitHub repo
3. **Auto-deployed** → Vercel deployed the template to production
4. **Cloned locally** → You cloned the GitHub repo to work on it locally

### Two Integration Workflows

#### Workflow 1: GitHub-Driven (Automatic) - Your Primary Method
```
GitHub Repo ←→ Vercel Project (Connected)
     ↓
Push to main branch → Auto-deploys to Production
Create PR → Auto-creates Preview Deployment
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic deployments
- Team collaboration through PRs
- Code review process
- Deployment history

#### Workflow 2: CLI-Driven (Manual) - Additional Control
```
Local Machine → Vercel CLI → Direct Deployment
     ↓
Skip GitHub entirely for quick tests
Or supplement GitHub workflow
```

**Benefits:**
- Quick testing without Git commits
- Emergency deployments
- Local development enhancement
- Environment variable management

---

## Setup Instructions

> **⚠️ Important:** The setup steps below depend on which team approach you choose (see Section 5: Team Member Vercel Setup Options). 
> - **Minimal Setup**: Only Jose needs steps 2-4 (Login & Link). Norma & Lily only need step 1 (CLI install)
> - **Full Access**: All team members need all steps 1-4
> - **Hybrid (Recommended)**: Jose needs all steps 1-4, Norma & Lily need steps 1 & 4 only

### 1. Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

### 2. Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```
**Who needs this:** 
- **Hybrid Approach (Recommended):** Jose only
- **Full Team Access:** All team members
- **Minimal Setup:** No one (skip this step)

### 3. Link Your Project
```bash
vercel link
```
This connects your local folder to your existing Vercel project.

**Who needs this:** Same as step 2 above.

### 4. Verify Setup
```bash
vercel --version
vercel whoami
```

## Team Member Vercel Setup Options

#### **Option 1: Simplified Setup (Recommended for Most Teams)**

**What each team member needs:**
```bash
# Team members use Next.js development server (Vercel-recommended)
npm run dev  # Perfect for frontend/UI and feature development

# Optional: Install Vercel CLI for enhanced workflow
npm i -g vercel  # Useful for preview deployments and CLI commands
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fast development with Next.js dev server
- ✅ No authentication required
- ✅ All Next.js features included (API routes, routing, hot reload)
- ✅ Officially recommended by Vercel for Next.js projects
- ✅ Perfect for team collaboration

**Vercel's Official Recommendation:**
> "If you're using a framework and your framework's Development Command already provides all the features you need, we do not recommend using vercel dev."

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Team member daily workflow
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
npm run dev  # Next.js development server - works immediately!
# Make changes, test locally
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Create PR on GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys preview
```

#### **Option 2: Full Team Access (For Advanced Teams)**

**What each team member needs:**
```bash
# 1. Create individual Vercel accounts (free)
# 2. Project owner invites team members to Vercel project
# 3. Each member links their local project
vercel login  # Login with their own account
vercel link   # Link to shared project
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Access to production environment variables
- ✅ Can create manual preview deployments
- ✅ Can view deployment logs and analytics
- ✅ Can manage environment variables

**Team Setup Process:**
```bash
# Project owner (Jose):
# 1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Members
# 2. Invite team members by email
# 3. Set appropriate permissions (Developer/Viewer)

# Team members (Norma & Lily):
# 1. Accept Vercel invitation email
# 2. Create Vercel account (if needed)
vercel login
vercel link  # Select the shared project
```

#### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Capstone)**

**Setup:**
- **Jose (Project Lead)**: Full Vercel CLI access for infrastructure management
- **Norma & Lily (Developers)**: Use `npm run dev` for daily development (Vercel-recommended)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Follows Vercel's official recommendations
- ✅ One person manages deployments and infrastructure
- ✅ Others get optimal development experience
- ✅ Clear responsibility structure
- ✅ No authentication complexity

```bash
# Jose (Project Lead) - Full Setup
vercel login
vercel link
vercel env pull .env.local  # Downloads production env vars

# Norma & Lily setup:
# No special setup needed! Just use Next.js development server
npm run dev  # Works immediately, no authentication required
# That's it! They use npm run dev (Next.js development server)
```

### Environment Variables Management

#### **Shared Development Environment Variables**
Create a `.env.example` file for team coordination:

```bash
# .env.example (committed to Git)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

#### **Team Member Environment Setup**
```bash
# Each team member creates their own .env.local
cp .env.example .env.local

# Fill in with development/test credentials
# Use test API keys, local database, etc.
```

### Vercel CLI Commands Without Account Linking

#### **What Works Without Authentication:**
```bash
npm run dev         # ✅ Next.js development server (RECOMMENDED)
npm install         # ✅ Install dependencies
git commands        # ✅ All Git operations
```

#### **What Requires Vercel Login:**
```bash
vercel dev          # ❌ Requires authentication for full functionality
vercel --prod=false # ❌ Requires linked project
vercel env pull     # ❌ Requires project access
vercel logs         # ❌ Requires project access
vercel ls          # ❌ Requires account access
```

### Recommended Workflow for Your Capstone Team

#### **Initial Setup (Jose - Project Lead Only):**
```bash
# Jose (Project Lead) - Full Setup
vercel login
vercel link
vercel env pull .env.local

# Create .env.example for team
cp .env.local .env.example
# Remove sensitive values, keep structure
git add .env.example
git commit -m "Add environment variables template"
git push origin main
```

#### **Team Member Setup (Norma & Lily):**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-team/nextjs-boilerplate.git
cd nextjs-boilerplate

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Set up local environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with development credentials

# Start development (RECOMMENDED)
npm run dev  # Next.js development server - perfect for most work!
```

#### **Daily Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Everyone follows the same process:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Start development server
npm run dev  # Next.js development server (recommended for most work)

# Make changes, test locally
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git push origin feature/your-feature

# Create PR on GitHub
# Vercel automatically creates preview deployment
# Team reviews PR and preview URL
# Merge when approved
```

### Security and Best Practices

#### **Environment Variable Security:**
- ✅ Never commit `.env.local` to Git (already in .gitignore)
- ✅ Use test/development API keys for local development
- ✅ Only project lead has access to production secrets
- ✅ Share development credentials through secure channels (not Slack/email)

#### **Team Access Control:**
```bash
# If using Option 2 (Full Team Access):
# Set appropriate Vercel permissions:
# - Project Lead: Admin
# - Developers: Developer (can deploy, view logs)
# - Others: Viewer (can view deployments only)
```

### Troubleshooting Team Setup

#### **Common Issues:**

**1. "Should I use vercel dev or npm run dev?"**
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Use npm run dev for most development work
npm run dev

# Why npm run dev is better for team members:
# - Works immediately after npm install
# - No authentication required
# - Includes all Next.js features (API routes, hot reload, routing)
# - Officially recommended by Vercel for Next.js projects

# Only use vercel dev when:
# - You need Edge middleware testing (rare)
# - Working with Vercel-specific routing
# - Jose needs production environment for infrastructure work
```

**2. Environment variables not available:**
```bash
# Team members should set up .env.local for development
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit with development credentials (Jose will provide these securely)

# For most development work, you don't need production environment variables
npm run dev  # Uses your local .env.local file
```

**3. Different team members seeing different behavior:**
```bash
# Ensure everyone is using the same approach
# All team members should use:
npm run dev  # Consistent Next.js development server

# Check versions if having issues
node --version
npm --version

# Update if needed
npm install -g npm@latest
```

## Practical Example - Combined Workflow

Let's add a contact form to demonstrate the complete workflow:

### Step 1: Local Development (For Jose - Infrastructure Lead)
```bash
# Start local dev with production environment (Jose only)
cd /home/jose/nextjs-boilerplate
vercel dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
# Jose has production environment variables available locally
# This is needed for infrastructure work and deployment testing
```

### Step 1: Local Development (For Team Members)
```bash
# Start local development (Norma & Lily)
cd /home/jose/nextjs-boilerplate
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
# Perfect for frontend/UI work and feature development
```

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b add-contact-form

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
```

### Step 3: Make Changes
```bash
# Edit your files (app/page.tsx, create API routes, etc.)
# Test changes with npm run dev running (for most team members)
# OR vercel dev running (for Jose's infrastructure work)
```

### Step 4: Quick Preview (CLI) - Optional
```bash
# Quick test deployment without Git commit
vercel --prod=false

# You'll get a preview URL like:
# https://nextjs-boilerplate-abc123.vercel.app
# Share this for quick feedback
```

### Step 5: Commit Changes
```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add contact form with email validation"

# Check status
git status
```

### Step 6: Push and Create PR
```bash
# Push branch to GitHub
git push origin add-contact-form

# Go to GitHub.com → Your repo → You'll see "Create Pull Request" button
# Click it and fill out the PR description
```

### Step 7: Automatic Preview Deployment
- Vercel automatically creates a preview deployment from your PR
- Preview URL appears as a comment in the PR
- Team can review both code and live preview

### Step 8: Review and Merge
- Team reviews your changes
- Test the preview deployment
- Once approved, merge the PR
- Vercel automatically deploys to production

### Step 9: Cleanup
```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Delete the feature branch (optional)
git branch -d add-contact-form
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "vercel command not found"
```bash
# Solution: Install globally
npm i -g vercel

# Or use npx
npx vercel
```

#### 2. "Project not linked"
```bash
# Solution: Link your project
vercel link

# Follow the prompts to connect to your existing Vercel project
```

#### 3. "Environment variables not working"
```bash
# Solution: Pull from production
vercel env pull .env.local

# Then restart your dev server
```

#### 4. "Git push rejected"
```bash
# Solution: Pull latest changes first
git pull origin main

# Then push again
git push origin your-branch-name
```

#### 5. "Preview deployment failed"
Check the Vercel dashboard for build logs:
```bash
# Or check logs via CLI
vercel logs <deployment-url>
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Branch Naming
Use descriptive branch names:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/contact-form
git checkout -b fix/navbar-mobile
git checkout -b update/dependencies
```

### 2. Commit Messages
Write clear commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "Add contact form with validation"
git commit -m "Fix responsive navbar on mobile"
git commit -m "Update dependencies to latest versions"
```

### 3. Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive data to Git
- Use `vercel env pull` to sync production variables
- Keep `.env.local` in `.gitignore`

### 4. Testing Strategy
1. **Local testing**: Use `npm run dev` for daily development work
2. **Preview testing**: Create PR for team review and automatic preview deployment
3. **Production monitoring**: Watch for errors after deployment
4. **Infrastructure testing**: Jose uses `vercel dev` when needed for deployment preparation

### 5. Deployment Strategy
- **Small changes**: Direct merge to main
- **Large features**: Use feature branches and PRs
- **Urgent fixes**: Use `vercel --prod` for emergency deployments

### 6. Team Collaboration
- Always create PRs for code review
- Use descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Test preview deployments before merging
- Communicate with team about breaking changes
